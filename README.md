# Analyzing Stock Market data using Visual Basic for Applications/Macro Scripting
 PURPOSE:
VBA scripting was created to loop through approximately 2800 company traded stocks on Wall Street. The scripting loops through all the stocks for one year, outputing information for three specific years: 2014, 2015 and 2016. 

The outputed information for each year are as follows:

1) The ticker symbol, 2) Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, 3)The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, 3)The total stock volume of the stock, and 4) Conditional formatting that will highlight positive price change in green and negative price change in red. VBA scripting also returns the stock with the "Greatest % Increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest Total Volume" for each year analyzed. Screenshots for each year is shown in the powerpoint document.


 SUMMARY:

VBA scripting was used on this project to automate routine tasks (output information 1 through 4 for a specific year). The scripting could be applied to any year for the same 2800 company traded stocks. I tested the scripting to ensure repeatable scripting, making the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script that allowed it to run on every worksheet (year - 2014, 2015, and 2016), just by running the VBA script once. I verified the script acted the same on each sheet and ran efficiently. The script takes the tediousness out of a repetitive task and runs over and over again with the click of the button.
